# Python Packages

## Packages

A Python package is a directory of Python modules. Packages are a way to organize your code by grouping related modules together. For example, you might have a package called `mypackage` that contains several modules, each of which defines a specific function or class.

#### Creating a package in python

To create a package in Python, you will need to follow these steps:

* Create a directory for your package, with a descriptive name that reflects the contents of the package.
* Inside the package directory, create a file named `__init__.py`. This file can be empty, or it can contain code that runs when the package is imported.
* Create one or more Python modules (i.e., files ending in `.py`) that contain the code you want to include in the package.
* Optionally, create a setup.py file at the top level of your package. This file can be used to specify metadata about your package, such as its name, version, and dependencies, and to automate the process of installing and distributing your package.
* Optionally, create a README.md file that describes the contents and purpose of your package, and any other relevant information.

For example, suppose you want to create a package called `my_package` that contains a module `my_module.py`. Here's how you might structure your package:

```
my_package/
├── __init__.py
├── my_module.py
└── setup.py
```

To use your package in another Python script, you would import it using the following syntax:

```python
import my_package.my_module
```

You can then access the contents of the package using the dot notation:

```python
my_package.my_module.specific_function()
```
