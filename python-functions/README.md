# Python Functions

### [What is a python function?](broken-reference)

In Python, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help you organize and reuse your code, making it more efficient and easier to understand.

Functions can also return multiple values, or no value at all. You can call a function multiple times in your code, and each time it will execute the code inside the function with the given input values.

* Functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the name of the function and a set of parentheses that may include parameters.
* The block of code that makes up the function is indented underneath the definition line.
* Functions may take arguments (also called parameters) that are specified in the parentheses of the function definition. These arguments are used to pass information into the function when it is called.
* Functions may return a value using the return keyword. If a function does not have a return statement, it returns None.
* Functions can be called by using their name followed by a set of parentheses that may include arguments.
* Functions can be defined inside other functions, in which case they are called inner functions. Inner functions can access the variables of the outer function in which they are defined.
* Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.
* Python has many built-in functions, and you can also define your own custom functions.
