# Function Definition

To define a function in Python, you use the def keyword, followed by the name of the function, and a set of parentheses (). The code block within the function is indented.

For example:

```
def call_mum():
    return "Hello Mum!"
```

To call a function, you use the function name followed by a set of parentheses

```
call_mum()
```
