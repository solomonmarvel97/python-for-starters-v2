# Iterable in python

In Python, an iterable is an object that can be used in a for loop to iterate over its elements. An iterable must implement the `__iter__` method, which returns an iterator, or the `__getitem__` method, which allows indexing of the object.

Some examples of iterable objects in Python are lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries.
