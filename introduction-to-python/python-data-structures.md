# Python Data Structures

### Python For Starters

[**Data Structures**](broken-reference)

In computer science, a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Python has a number of built-in data structures, which can be used to store and organize data efficiently.

Python's basic data structures include list, set, tuples, and dictionary. Each data structure is distinct in its own way. Data structures are "containers" that organize and categorize data. The mutability and order of the data structures differs from one data structure to the other.

Some of the most common data structures in Python include:

* Lists
* Tuples
* Dictionaries
* Sets
* Strings
