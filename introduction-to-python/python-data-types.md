# Python Data Types

#### [Data Types](broken-reference) <a href="#data-types" id="data-types"></a>

For short, a data type describes a set of possible values and operations that can be performed on a variable

In Python, a data type is a category for values. Every value in Python has a data type, which determines the kind of operations that can be performed on that value and the way the value can be stored in memory.

There are several built-in data types in Python, including:

* Numbers: Python has three types of numbers: integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), and complex numbers (complex). Integers are whole numbers, while floating-point numbers have decimal points. Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part.
* Strings: A string is a sequence of characters, represented by either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). Strings can contain letters, numbers, and special characters.
* Lists: A list is an ordered collection of values that can be of any data type. Lists are written as a series of values separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets.
* Tuples: A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable, meaning that its values cannot be modified once it is created. Tuples are written as a series of values separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.
* Sets: A set is an unordered collection of unique values. Sets are written as a series of values separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces.
* Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. The keys must be unique and are used to retrieve the corresponding values. Dictionaries are written as a series of key-value pairs separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces.

In addition to these built-in data types, you can also define your own data types in Python using classes (more of this in an advanced topic)
