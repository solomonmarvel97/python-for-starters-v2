# Virtual Environments

### What is a virtual environment?

A virtual environment is a separate environment in which you can install Python packages and run Python scripts without affecting the packages and scripts in the global environment. Virtual environments are useful when you have different projects that require different versions of packages, or when you want to isolate a particular project from the rest of your system.
